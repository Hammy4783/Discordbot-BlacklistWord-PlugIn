# Discordbot-BlacklistWord-PlugIn
Here is a script, coded in discord.py (python) with this script you can edit the list of words you would like to be blacklisted and the amount of times it can be used before banning a user.


Too keep things simple; "limit" is configurable the defulat setting it 7 but feel free to change it. The limit feature allowes the amount of times the word can be said before a banned for example if your trying to add a no profanity on your custom bot you will set the limit to 1 and add the words you wish to block in the list ['word'}

NOTE: If you want the bot to bloxk more words just make the list bigger.

 If you have any questions or would like to speak with me for custom bot commsions you can contact me at https://discord.gg/nHHEUvJF9h
